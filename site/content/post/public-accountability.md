I've only recently appreciated the magic effects that public accountability can have.

For years I have been struggling with a certain inner demon that has to do with a habit of mine.
I fought with it endlessly, tried everything, and never really managed to slay it. Not even close.

Recently, I've tried something different, and it worked really well: I made a declaration of my intentions to quit the habit to my friends. This worked surprisingly well.

Rather than battling the demon internally, I dragged it out of my head.
And this significantly transformed the fight.
In previous attempts, the battle it was between two sides of me: the habit side, and the side that didn't want the habit.
After making a "promise" to my friends, the fight changed.
The habit was now up against the part of me that likes to be reliable and keep promises. That part is pretty strong.
So from one day to the next, the habit is gone without too much effort.

I want to see if I can  apply this apply this technique to something else.

There's a project I've been meaning to work for months **Rholodex** (working title).

I've tried multiple ways, but I never seem to be able to get started.
The time I allocate to it, seems to always get wasted some other way.

This brings me here. Trying once more to get this project off the ground, this time starting with a public commitment.

The idea is:

 * Promise what I'll do next through a post like this one
 * Deliver what I promised
 * Repeat

### Today's goal

 - Write this first post
 - Publish this repository on GitHub and this site on GitHub Pages

### Next goal

 - Fill the site with minimal information: project description, motivation and architecture
 - Write another post describing the next step and concrete deliverables
